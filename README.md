# Oxford Pet Image Segmentation Using Deep Neural Network and U-Net

By using this project, you will be able to detect the animals or the object that you are expecting to see in segmentation.


## Installation
*Before, we start the installation make sure you should have G.P.U. setup.*

- 1 : Install tensorflow and tensorflow-datasets by `pip install tensorflow tensorflow-datasets`.
- 2 : For Pix2Pix model, you have to install tensorflow-examples by `pip install -q git+https://github.com/tensorflow/examples.git`.
- 3 : In the last matplotlib shoud have installed, if not `pip install matplotlib`.
    
## GPU Setup

- If you have a GPU, then go through this page and you will able to leverage the power of GPU for your Deep Neural Network.

- If you don't have GPU, then I will highly recommend you to go Google Colab or Kaggle to work through this.
